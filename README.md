Comments:
For this assignment, I have a total of 6 functions, 4 of which were not required but that I've chosen to implement. These four functions are swap, grow_array, shiftdown (for the remove function), and leaf (which checks to see if an element is a leaf).
Other than that, the code adheres to the requirements and recommendations in the assignment.
